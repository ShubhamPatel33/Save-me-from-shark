## Inspiration
To save some preys from Sharks

## What it does
It makes a buzzer sound and blows an LED light so that sea animals and humans from far can see the shark and can save there lives
It will also give ability to make ultrasound to other water species as an advantage if we use this on other animals.
## How we built it
I build it using Arduino simulator an ultrasonic sensor some wires and LED + my knowledge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Saving lives of other animals and humans.

## What's next for Save Me From Shark
A more advanced circuit.## Inspiration
